            </h2>

            <p>
                Segment is a data collection and transformation tool. The clearest analogy is that the Segment product acts as a train system for data and the Segment web app is Grand Central station. Trains of data are coming from websites and mobile apps, stopping at Grand Central, and heading to their next destinations. Each passenger is a packet of data.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Customers use the Debugger feature to identify problems with the data trains that are coming in (e.g. maybe it’s missing 1 or 2 passengers) and the code that is being sent out (e.g. passengers are getting on the wrong trains and going to incorrect destinations).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We had gotten a lot of feedback in the past year that the Debugger experience had become increasingly poor. This made sense since it had not been fundamentally redesigned since 2014. This feedback reflected the shared sentiment that improving the Debugger would have a positive impact on our customers’ workflow and the value they derived from Segment. The Debugger, though a less "sexy" product feature, is foundational and a bad experience with it will inevitably result in broken workflows, frustrated users, an increase in tickets, and potentially mistrust in our product. This is an essential tool for diagnosing issues, building credibility with our users by giving them access to all data that flows through Segment.

                <p>
                User interviews, usage reporting, user stories, sketches, UI design feedback (final design executed by K. Babula), project management, proposal creation.

                <br>
                <p>
                A note on my involvement: In the past year, I had noticed a pattern of customers giving feedback that the Debugger was difficult to use. I found their use case to be compelling and approached one of our lead designers to explore this as a hack week project. The problem was ultimately large enough that we worked past hack week for four more weeks on this project.
